    "There are  614 listings with no review_scores_rating (NaN) values. We will handle this by turning the review_scores_ratings into a categorical predictor. Based on the histogram, we see that a vast majority of the listings seem to have overall favorable ratings; i.e. skewed left distribution. We replace any NaN values that have no review with 'No Reviews' and we remove any remaining inconsistent NaN values that have a number_of_reviews > 0. We will also convert the review_scores_ratings into buckets. We will have the bucket ranges set more closely to a higher review score to accomodate for the skewed left distribution of the review scores."
