## In this project a Machine Learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, that helps customers to get optimal nightly rent price with respect to different parameters that affect the pricing of the houses, like city, number of rooms, location, property type, etc.

The datasetfor trainig  places in repository -  Train.csv

Overview

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Data cleaning (i.e. handling missing data, etc)
Data visualization
Data preprocessing
Feature Selection
Implementing RandomTree and DecissionTree model 
Tuning parameters 
Predict the pricing using test set
Predict the pricing for Submission dataset
Brief explanation of each step

Data Cleaning

Missing values were found in bathrooms, bedrooms, beds, review_scores_rating, host_response_rate and etc.
For bathrooms, bedrooms, beds, review_scores_rating  any NA values were droped.

Model Implementation

Was used 2 models Randomtree and DessionTree (based on price plot diagram)

After tuning parameters the best result was from RandomTree model with n_estimators = 50.

Result
Ð¡onsequently, in modelling procces were received accuracy 66, 52 % with Mean squared error 32.9

RandomTree model was applied for Submission.csv dataset. Priced was predicted and wrote to submission_final.csv file.
